/*
  DEPRECATED: This file is no longer needed.

  All animations like 'fade-in-up' and 'fade-in-fast' have been replaced 
  with the Framer Motion library for superior performance, interactivity, 
  and maintainability, as per the project's modern UI/UX guidelines.

  Animations are now defined directly within their respective React components.
